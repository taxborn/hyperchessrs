# A [4DChess](https://esolangs.org/wiki/4DChess) interpreter in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

As described from it's esolangs wiki page:

> 4DChess is an esoteric programming language designed by User: Zemeckis on 18th November, 2019. It is directly inspired from Brainf\*\*\*. Instead of brain\*\*\*'s usual one-dimensional memory cell array, 4DChess uses a four-dimensional hypercube-like memory cell array of 8 cells per dimension.
